This is a feature branch of `react-universally` that is currently built against `v12.0.0`.

It provides you with a simple Style Components integration.

## Known Issues
  Currently there is an [issue](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/issues/157) trying to use `import` instead of `require` when working with `styled-components`.

  Also, there is a [PR pending](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components/pull/214) for SSR support, so this functionality is not _yet_ available for this branch.

# About

  This is the `react-universally-styled-components` feature repository for `react-universally` starter kit.

  It provides you with the build tooling and configuration you need to kick off your next universal react project with full support for Styled Components.

  Look into `Header` and `Menu` components to check how the wrappers for these are styled using styled-components.
